# Doctor
First time extending a class 
Doctor is a class defined whose objects are records for a clinic’s doctors.  Doctor is derived from the class Person.  A Doctor record has the doctor’s name–defined in the class Person,—a specialty as a string, and an office visit fee (use the type double).  The class has a reasonable complement of constructor and accessor methods, and an equals method as well.  Additionally, there is a driver program that tests all your methods.
